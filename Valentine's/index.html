            <h2>My 💖 Letter to You 💌</h2>
            <p>Dear Sam 🦋, My Pookie, Sweetie, Cutie, and Everything in Between,</p>
            <p>From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. You brought a light so bright that it outshone
                every shadow, and a warmth so comforting that it melted every worry away. You’re not just my love;
                you’re my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest adventure.</p>
            <p><strong>Sam</strong>, you’re the one who makes my heart race with just a smile.<br>
                <strong>Pookie</strong>, you’re the one who turns ordinary days into extraordinary memories.<br>
                <strong>Sweetie</strong>, you’re the one who makes me believe in magic because loving you feels like a
                fairytale.<br>
                <strong>Cutie</strong>, you’re the one who makes my world brighter just by being in it.
            </p>
            <p>I don’t need pictures of us together to know how much you mean to me. Every moment with you, whether it’s
                a laugh, a conversation, or even a quiet glance, is etched in my heart forever. You’re my favorite
                person, my safe place, and my forever.</p>
            <p>I love the way you light up a room with your laughter. I love how you care so deeply about the people you
                love. And most of all, I love how you make me feel like the luckiest person in the world just by being
                you.</p>
            <p>This Valentine’s Day, I want you to know that my love for you isn’t just today—it’s every day. It’s in
                the little things, the big moments, and everything in between. You’re my always and forever, and I can’t
                wait to create so many more memories with you.</p>
            <p>Yours always and forever,<br> Priyabrata 🧸💖</p>
